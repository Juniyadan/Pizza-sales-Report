# Comprehensive Pizza Sales Analysis and Performance Dashboardüçï

### Project Overview

In my Pizza Sales Project, I have developed an insightful Power BI report that provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data. The report includes daily and monthly sales trends, allowing for an in-depth view of how sales evolve over time. Additionally, I have highlighted the "hits" and "flops" of different pizzas, helping to identify the most and least popular menu items. The sales performance overview provides key metrics such as revenue, order volume, and customer preferences, enabling a thorough understanding of business performance and aiding in strategic decision-making


### Data Source

### Tools
- SQL Server
- PowerBI


### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Data cleaning was applied to the Pizza Size column by replacing the letter codes with the full size names for clarity. Additionally, a new column for Day Name was created, displaying only the first three letters of each day (e.g., Mon, Tue). Similarly, a Month Name column was generated, following the same three-letter format for each month (e.g., Jan, Feb).

A new measure was created to calculate key performance metrics, including 
- Average Order Value
- Average Pizzas per Order
- Total Orders
- Total Pizzas Sold
-  Total Revenue
  
these measures provide valuable insights into the overall performance of the pizza sales, helping to assess business efficiency and profitability.

### Insights
In this report, my key findings include identifying the most and least popular pizzas, with certain flavors consistently driving higher sales ("hits") while others underperformed ("flops"). Additionally, the daily and monthly sales trends revealed peak sales periods, helping to optimize marketing efforts. The metrics, such as Average Order Value and Total Revenue, highlighted customer spending patterns, while Average Pizzas per Order indicated preferences in bulk ordering. Overall, these insights are crucial for enhancing product offerings, pricing strategies, and inventory management

In this project, I've discovered several key insights. Day-wise, Saturday and Friday are the busiest days, while month-wise, July and January see the highest sales. Regarding pizza categories, the Classic category contributes the most to overall sales and total orders. Size-wise, large pizzas account for the majority of sales.

For specific pizza performance:

- Thai Chicken Pizza contributes the most to total revenue.

- Classic Deluxe Pizza has the highest total orders.

- Brie Carre Pizza contributes the least to both revenue and total orders.

### Recommendation
 Based on these insights, the following recommendations can be made to the sales team:

1. Focus on Peak Days and Months: Since Saturday, Friday, July, and January are the busiest periods, consider implementing promotions or special offers during these times to maximize sales further.


2. Promote the Classic Category and Large Pizzas: As the Classic category and large pizzas contribute the most to sales, prioritize marketing these options and ensure sufficient stock to meet demand.


3. Leverage Top-Performing Pizzas: Highlight and promote Thai Chicken Pizza and Classic Deluxe Pizza, as they are the top performers in terms of revenue and total orders, respectively. Offering bundle deals or upsells around these popular options could increase sales.


4. Address Low-Performing Items: Consider either promoting or reevaluating the Brie Carre Pizza, as it contributes the least to revenue and orders. Adjustments in pricing, marketing, or even menu placement could improve its performance.
